# Test-website

<p> - a basic website for login and signup using PHP and MySQL.</p>

<p> - The Website includes a Signup and a Login page with a proper verification system which verifies (from the database) and updates the database accordingly to the user input. Also the welcome page upon successfull login includes a link to a form which indeed is connected to another MySQL database. </p>
<p> - There is a link to a Blog , an image gallery and also other projects I've done during my Internship . </p>
<p> - Proper measures have been taken for data integrity and safety. Proper measures have been taken for preventing SQL injections (using parametric binding) </p>
<p> - For the back end PHP and MySQL are used. </p>
<p> - For the front end Bootstrap library has been used throughout the website . Particle.js has also been used for few things. Gradually the whole background theme of the website will be a Particle.js template. </p>

<strong> Note: This is a practice project which is part of my Summer Internship. </strong>
